# Newton's Rings Simulation

This MATLAB script simulates **Newton‚Äôs Rings** ‚Äî a classic interference pattern created by the reflection of light between two surfaces, typically a plano-convex lens and a flat glass surface.

It also optionally simulates:
- A **surface defect**, modeled as a bump in the lens.
- A **thin film layer**, which alters the fringe pattern.

## üß† Concepts Involved

- **Interference of light**
- **Thin film interference**
- **Phase difference and intensity calculation**
- **Optical path differences**
- **Theoretical prediction of fringe radii**

## üìå Features

- Simulates circular interference rings caused by monochromatic light.
- Allows simulation of defects like bumps on the lens surface.
- Models the effect of an added thin film (e.g., to simulate air gaps or coatings).
- Overlays theoretical ring radii for validation.
- Displays intensity cross-section when thin film is enabled.

## üìà Output

1. **Newton's Rings Visualization**  
   A grayscale image showing the ring pattern, with optional annotations for theoretical rings.

2. **Cross-Section Plot** (only if `thin_film = true`)  
   Shows the intensity along a horizontal slice, useful for visualizing fringe shifts.

3. **Command Line Output**  
   Displays theoretical radii of rings and thin film data (if applicable).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open the script in MATLAB.
2. Set the parameters at the top to customize the simulation.
3. Run the script using the MATLAB Run button or `F5`.

## üß™ Example Use Cases

- **Physics education demos**
- **Optics research visualizations**
- **Studying fringe pattern distortions due to defects or films**

---

## üîß Customization Tips

- To enable surface defect simulation:
  ```matlab
  surface_defect = true;
  ```

- To simulate a thin film:
  ```matlab
  thin_film = true;
  ```

- Adjust `defect_size`, `film_thickness`, etc., to explore their effects.
